College Project
This is the project named "Car Rental Management System".
It contains two sections :
1. ADMIN
2. USER
Admin is protected by default username and password. Admin have following functions:
1. ALL BOOKINGS
2. SEARCH
3. CANCEL A BOOKING

whereas User gets following options:
1. Rent car with self drive 
2. Book a trip (Uses floyyd warshall algorithm to calculate the minimum distance from pickup point to destination and calculate the minimum rent)
3.Search the Booking
4.Cancel Booking


Here we used "Floyd Warshall" algorithm to calaculate the shortest path between the source and destination of rider which also helps rider to know how must cost they have to pay as we have calculated the fare based on distance.
